Writing clean, readable code is essential for any software development project. Clean code is not only easier to maintain but also improves collaboration between developers. Here are some best practices for writing clean code:

### Tips for Writing Clean Code

- **Use meaningful names**: Variables, functions, and class names should describe their purpose.
- **Keep functions small**: Functions should perform one task and do it well.
- **Avoid repetition**: Donâ€™t write the same code more than once. Instead, create reusable functions and components.

By following these guidelines, you can create code that is easy to understand, maintain, and scale.
