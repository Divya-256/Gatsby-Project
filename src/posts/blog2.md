JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js have revolutionized web development. These frameworks help developers build dynamic and responsive user interfaces by providing reusable components, state management, and a streamlined development process.

### React vs. Angular vs. Vue

- **React**: A library for building user interfaces, React is known for its flexibility and high performance.
- **Angular**: A full-fledged framework developed by Google, Angular is ideal for large-scale applications.
- **Vue**: A progressive framework that is easy to integrate and provides a simple yet powerful API.

Choosing the right framework depends on the project requirements and the developer's expertise.
