Responsive Web Design (RWD) ensures that websites look good and function well on all devices, from desktop computers to smartphones. It involves creating flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

### Key Principles of Responsive Design

- **Fluid Grids**: Instead of fixed pixel-based layouts, use relative units like percentages to create fluid grids.
- **Media Queries**: These allow you to apply different styles based on the screen size or device type.
- **Flexible Images**: Images should resize according to the container, ensuring they look good on different screen sizes.

Responsive design is a must for modern websites, as mobile traffic continues to rise.
