Version control is a system that allows developers to track and manage changes to a codebase over time. The most popular version control system is Git, which allows teams to collaborate on projects and ensures that changes are tracked and reversible.

### Why Version Control is Essential

- **Collaboration**: Version control enables multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.
- **History Tracking**: With version control, you can track every change made to the codebase and revert to previous versions if needed.
- **Branching**: You can create branches to work on features or fixes separately, merging them into the main codebase when ready.

Using version control is crucial for maintaining code integrity and improving team collaboration.
